# A bit about me

## Programming
I'm a fourth year Mathematics and Computer Science major at UCSD. I don't have any dedicated interests within programming ***yet***. I am still broadening my horizons to see what flavor of programming I prefer. This quarter, I will be learning web development skills as well as being introduced both mathematically and through application to supervised learning. I am also foraying into computer graphics. As of currently, my methodology with my education has been to go as wide as possible and expose myself to many subjects, both within computer science and mathematics. A project I am working on right now is creating a monitor configurator for Windows and Wayland desktop managers in Golang using the Fyne library for a GUI.

Languages I am currently learning:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python

Languages that I have learned (chronological order)
1. Java
2. C++
3. C
4. SQL
5. Bash
6. R
7. Golang

## Personal life
I'm a transfer student, and this is my fourth and last quarter at UCSD. In my freetime, I usually just talk with my girlfriend, but aside from that, I like to play videogames and inline skate. This last summer, I have gotten particularly into the dance pad rhythm game [Pump It Up](https://www.piugame.com/piu.xx/), which is like Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), except it has 5 buttons. My favorite place to skate is along the northwest portion of Mission Bay, especially around sunset. I also enjoy ~~beer~~ tea a lot<sup>I like them both dark :)</sup>.
